## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ NEWCOMERS AND CROWDSUPPLY BUYERS: PLEASE READ THIS FIRST ⚠️⚠️⚠️

At the moment the project does not see much activity because the founder and primary maintainer, [Catherine @whitequark](https://github.com/whitequark), has spent several years struggling to survive due to disability, large scale social unrest, and other factors. She has now moved to the UK, got necessary healthcare, and is doing a lot better; the project's pace will pick up soon and more maintainers will be added to the current team of three in close future, but the timing of Crowdsupply orders being shipped doesn't match up to maintainer capacity a little bit.

Please stay patient and keep in mind that hardware is made by people who have limited capacity and sometimes need to recover from extreme events.

If you want to show appreciation or help with Catherine's living costs, she has a personal [Patreon](https://patreon.com/whitequark). These donations will not impact the progress of the project since the limiting factor is health first and time second, but they are very much appreciated.
