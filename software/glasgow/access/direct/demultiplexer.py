# On Linux, the total amount of in-flight USB requests for the entire system is limited
# by usbfs_memory_mb parameter of the module usbcore; it is 16 MB by default. This
# limitation was introduced in commit add1aaeabe6b08ed26381a2a06e505b2f09c3ba5, with
# the following (bullshit) justification:
#
#   While it is generally a good idea to avoid large transfer buffers
#   (because the data has to be bounced to/from a contiguous kernel-space
#   buffer), it's not the kernel's job to enforce such limits.  Programs
#   should be allowed to submit URBs as large as they like; if there isn't
#   sufficient contiguous memory available then the submission will fail
#   with a simple ENOMEM error.
#
#   On the other hand, we would like to prevent programs from submitting a
#   lot of small URBs and using up all the DMA-able kernel memory. [...]
#
# In other words, there is a platform-specific limit for USB I/O size, which is not discoverable
# via libusb, and hitting which does not result in a sensible error returned  from libusb
# (it returns LIBUSB_ERROR_IO even though USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB ioctl correctly returns -ENOMEM),
# so it is not even possible to be optimistic and back off after hitting it.
#
# To deal with this, use requests of at most 1024 EP buffer sizes (512 KiB with the FX2) as
# an arbitrary cutoff, and hope for the best.
_max_packets_per_ep = 1024

# USB has the limitation that all transactions are host-initiated. Therefore, if we do not queue
# reads for the IN endpoints quickly enough, the HC will not even poll the device, and the buffer
# will quickly overflow (provided it is being filled with data). To address this, we issue many
# pipelined reads, to compensate for the non-realtime nature of Python and the host OS.
#
# This, however, has an inherent tradeoff. If we submit small reads (down to a single EP buffer
# size), we get the data back as early as possible, but the CPU load is much higher, and we have
# to submit many more buffers to tolerate the same amount of scheduling latency. If we submit large
# reads, it's much easier to service the device quickly enough, but the maximum latency of reads
# rises.
#
# The relationship between buffer size and latency is quite complex. If only one 512-byte buffer
# is available but a 10240-byte read is requested, the read will finish almost immediately with
# those 512 bytes. On the other hand, if 20 512-byte buffers are available and the HC can read one
# each time it sends an IN token, they will all be read before the read finishes; if we request
# a read of dozens of megabytes, this can take seconds.
#
# To try and balance these effects, we choose a medium buffer size that should work well with most
# applications. It's possible that this will need to become customizable later, but for now
# a single fixed value works.

# are diminishing.
