# Overview
# --------
#
# The FX2 has four FIFOs, but only one at a time may be selected to be read (for OUT FIFOs) or
# written (for IN FIFOs). To achieve high transfer rates when more than one stream of data is used
# (bidirectional channel, two one-directional channels, and so on), the FPGA has its own FIFOs that
# mirror the FX2 FIFOs. The FX2 crossbar switch is the gateware that coordinates transfers between
# these FIFOs, up to eight total depending on application requirements.
#
# Timing issues
# -------------
#
# The FX2 can work in asynchronous or synchronous FIFO mode. The asynchronous mode is a bit of
# a relic; the maximum throughput is much lower as well, so it's not useful. The synchronous mode
# can source or accept a clock, and timings change based on this.
#
# Using fast parallel synchronous interfaces on an FPGA is a bit tricky. It is never safe to
# drive a bus with combinatorial logic directly, or drive combinatorial logic from a bus, because
# the timing relationship is neither defined (the inferred logic depth may vary, and placement
# further affects it) nor easily enforced (it's quite nontrivial to define the right timing
# constraints, if the toolchain allows it at all).
#
# The way to make things work is use a register placed inside the FPGA I/O buffer and clocked by
# a global clock network; this makes timings consistent regardless of inferred logic or placement,
# and the I/O buffer is qualified by only two main properties: clock-to-output delay, and input
# capture window. Unfortunately, this adds pipelining, which complicates feedback. For example, if
# the FPGA is asserting a write strobe and waiting for a full flag to go high, it will observe
# the flag as high one cycle late, by which point the FIFO has overflowed, and it would take
# another cycle for the write strobe to deassert; if the flag went high for just one cycle, then
# a spurious write will also happen after the overflow.
#
# Worse yet, the combination of the FX2 and iCE40 FPGA creates another hazard. The input capture
# window of the FPGA is long before the signals output by the FX2 are valid, and to counteract
# this, we have to add a delay--in practice this means using DDR inputs and capturing on negative
# clock edge. However, doing that alone would effectively halve our maximum frequency, so it's
# necessary to re-register the input in fabric. That adds another cycle of latency.
#
# The FX2 has a way to compensate for one cycle of latency, the INFM1 and OEP1 FIFO configuration
# bits. Unfortunately, this is not enough. Not only there are three cycles of latency total, but
# this feature does not help avoiding FIFO overflows at all. For IN FIFOs, if the full flag goes
# high one cycle before the full condition, and the FPGA-side FIFO is empty, the FX2-side FIFO
# looks full (so if the crossbar switches to a different FIFO, it wouldn't try to fill it again),
# but the packet in that FIFO is incomplete and not sent (so it'll never become non-full again).
# For OUT FIFOs, the empty flag and the data are aligned in time, but when the FPGA-side FIFO
# becomes full and the FPGA deasserts the read strobe, it's too late, as up to one more byte is
# already in the FPGA input register. Similarly, if the empty flag is asserted for just one cycle,
# and the crossbar switches to another FIFO pair, the tail end of the read strobe would cause
# a spurious read.
#
# Handling pipelining
# -------------------
#
# This unintentional pipelining is handled in two ways, different for IN and OUT FIFOs. The core
# of the difference is that the FPGA controls the FX2-side IN FIFO, but the host controls
# the OUT FIFO.
#
# For IN FIFOs, the solution is to track the FIFO level on the FPGA using a counter. This creates
# a "perfect" full flag on the FPGA, and simplifies other things as well, such as ZLP generation.
# (More on that later.)
#
# The host may explicitly purge the FX2-side FIFOs in some circumstances, e.g. changing the USB
# configuration or interface altsetting, which would require resetting the IN level counter, but
# this requires resetting the FPGA-side FIFO contents anyway, so it already has to be coordinated
# via some out-of-band mechanism.
#
# For OUT FIFOs, the solution is to use an skid buffer--a very small additional FIFO in front
# of the normal large FPGA-side FIFO to absorb any writes that may happen after the strobe was
# deasserted. (A naive approach would be to compare the FPGA-side FIFO level to get an "almost
# full" marker, but this does not work if that FIFO is used to bridge clock domains, and in any
# case it would result in more logic.)
#
# Moreover, for correct results, the FIFO address (the index of the FX2 FIFO in use) and read
# strobe must be synchronized to the data valid flag (i.e. inverse of empty flag) and the data;
# that is, the FIFO address and read strobe must be delayed by 3 cycles and used to select and
# enable writes to the FPGA-side FIFO. Essentially, the FPGA-side FIFO should be driven by
# the control signals as seen by the FX2, because only then the FX2 outputsÂ are meaningful.
#
# Once the control signals that indicate FX2's state are appropriately received, generated or
# regenerated, the purpose of the rest of the crossbar is only to provide stimulus to the FX2,
# i.e. switch between addresses and generate read, write and packet end strobes.
#
# Handling packetization
# ----------------------
#
# There is one more concern that needs to be handled by the crossbar. The FIFOs provided on
# the FPGA are a byte-oriented abstraction; they have no inherent packet boundaries. However, USB
# is a packet-oriented bus. Therefore, for IN FIFOs, the crossbar has to insert packet boundaries,
# and because bulk endpoints place no particular requirements on when the host controller will poll
# them, the choices made during packetization have a major impact on performance. (For OUT FIFOs,
# the host inserts packet boundaries, and since no particular guarantees are provided by the FX2
# as to behavior of the empty flag between packets, it doesn't make sense to expose a packet-
# oriented interface to the rest of FPGA gateware, as it would be very asymmetric.)
#
# To provide control over IN packet boundaries, the crossbar uses a flush flag. If it has been
# asserted, and the FX2-side FIFO has an incomplete packet in it, and the FPGA-side FIFO is empty,
# the FX2 is instructed to send the incomplete packet as-is.
#
# To achieve the highest throughput, it is necessary to send long packets, since the FX2 only has
# up to 4 buffers per packet (in 2-endpoint mode; 2 buffers in 4-endpoint mode), and the longer
# the packets are, the higher is the FX2-side buffer utilization. However, this is only taking
# the FX2 and USB protocol into account. If we consider the host controller and OS as well, it
# becomes apparent that it is necessary to send maximum length packets.
#
# To understand the reason for this, consider that an application has to provide the OS with
# a buffer to fill with data read from the USB device. This buffer has to be a multiple of
# the maximum packet size; if more data is returned, the extra data is discarded and an error
# is indicated. However, what happens if less data is returned? In that case, the OS returns
# the buffer to the application immediately. This can dramatically reduce performance: if
# the application queues 10 8192-byte buffers, and the device returns 512 byte maximum-length
# packets, then 160 packets can be received. However, if the device returns 511 byte packets,
# then only 10 packets will be received!
#
# Unfortunately, if a device returns (for example) a single maximum-length packet and then stops,
# then the OS will hold onto the buffer, assuming that there is more data to come; this will appear
# as a hang. To indicate to the OS that there really is no more data, a zero-length packet needs
# to be generated. This is where the IN FIFO level counter comes in handy as well.
