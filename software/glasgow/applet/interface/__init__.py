"""
The ``interface`` taxon is the most fundamental and generic applet taxon. It groups applets
implementing interfaces that are used for purposes that do not fit into any single other taxon.

Because the ``interface`` taxon is so important, the applet names in this taxon are not prefixed
with the taxon name.

Examples: SPI, I²C.
Counterexamples: MIDI (use taxon ``audio``).
