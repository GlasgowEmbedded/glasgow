# PS/2 Physical Layer
# -------------------
#
# The physical layer as described in IBM PS/2 Hardware Technical Reference is reminiscent of
# half-duplex SPI, but this comparison is misleading. In fact, tracing the communication of PS/2
# devices, one can notice that sample/setup points appear to be shifted 90° in phase compared to
# the clock, i.e. they are not edge triggered. This is similar to how an I²C master should be
# implemented (but often isn't). The IBM keyboard reference describes that "Data is valid before
# the trailing edge and beyond the leading edge of the clock pulse", so the host may sample at
# either edge or anywhere during the low half-period of the clock.
#
# PS/2 Protocol Framing
# ---------------------
#
# It is often asserted in materials about the PS/2 protocol with varying degrees of confidence
# that the protocol is byte-oriented. This is, essentially, false. The protocol is packet-oriented,
# with the host always sending 1-byte packets, and the device responding with fixed-size packets,
# although the packet size is not always known in advance, e.g. in case of the identification data
# and keyboard scan codes.
#
# The host and the device may synchronize by using the fact that the device will always interrupt
# the current packet it is sending, whether solicited or unsolicited, and start processing
# the newly sent command. While well-defined on protocol level, lack of explicit frame boundaries
# is a significant problem for a system employing extensive device-, OS- and application-level
# buffering like Glasgow, since it is impossible to say apriori whether the byte that was just
# received is in response to a command or not. (Explicit sequence points would fix a half of this
# problem, but are not completely robust when combined with variable length responses and packets
# sent unsolicited by the device.)
#
# The Intel 8042 controller fixes, or rather works around, this problem by completely encapsulating
# the handling of PS/2. In fact many (if not most) PS/2 commands that are sent to i8042 result in
# no PS/2 traffic at all, with their response being either synthesized on the fly on the i8042, or,
# even worse, them being an in-band commands to i8042 itself. This lead mice developers to a quite
# horrifying response: any advanced settings are conveyed to the mouse and back by abusing
# the sensitivity adjustment commands as 2-bit at a time a communication channel; keyboards use
# similar hacks.
#
# In this applet, we solve this problem by treating the PS/2 device rather harshly: it is only
# allowed to speak when we permit it to, i.e. all communication is host-initiated. (This is quite
# awkward when combined with the clock being device-generated...) Each time the host initiates
# a communication, it optionally sends a command byte (all commands are single byte), and receives
# exactly as many response bytes as a higher layer determines is necessary, then inhibits
# the clock. As a result, the command responses that are longer than expected are cut short (but
# the higher layer cannot process them anyway), and unsolicited packets are dropped when they are
# not actively polled by a higher layer. In exchange, the communication is always deterministic.
#
# PS/2 Command Assignment
# -----------------------
#
# Observing the assignment of keyboard and mouse commands in PS/2, it might be deduced that in-band
# i8042 controller commands were assigned from 00 upwards, that keyboard commands were assigned
# from FF downwards, and the auxiliary device (mouse, etc) commands were assigned the same numbers
# as keyboard commands when there was an equivalent one, or from EB downwards, lowest assigned
# keyboard command being EC (Reset Wrap Mode). See the respective keyboard and mouse applets for
# details on the command set.
