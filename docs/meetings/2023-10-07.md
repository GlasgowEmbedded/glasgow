### [#415](https://github.com/GlasgowEmbedded/glasgow/issues/415) - Case Options Mentioned in Docs

Assignee: @attie (to review)

- 3D print and laser-cut case designs exist, both need review for compatibility with revC3
- **Don't** add link in docs until revC3 compatibility is confirmed

### [#422](https://github.com/GlasgowEmbedded/glasgow/issues/422) - TypeError when running `glasgow`

Assignee: @whitequark

- Turns out this is likely related to older patch releases of Python
  - `<=3.9.10` is broken (including `3.9.5` as shipped in "_universe_" repo for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
  - `<=3.10.2` is broken
- High priority, do not want to instruct users on additional system setup steps
