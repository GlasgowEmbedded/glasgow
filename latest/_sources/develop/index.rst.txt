Development process
===================

As an end user, you will most likely work only on :ref:`applets <applet>` and :ref:`documentation <docs>`. Development of :ref:`software <software>`, :ref:`firmware <firmware>`, and :ref:`hardware <hardware>` are advanced topics, and these pages are only used for sharing knowledge among already experienced developers rather than teaching the required skills.
