=======

The Glasgow Interface Explorer source code, documentation, and design files are distributed under a choice of two licenses: 0-clause BSD and Apache 2.0.

Catherine "whitequark", who has started the project, opposes copyright on moral and philosophical grounds, and the choice of the 0-clause BSD license reflects that. In addition, the Apache 2.0 license includes a patent grant, which protects manufacturers of open hardware from litigation.
