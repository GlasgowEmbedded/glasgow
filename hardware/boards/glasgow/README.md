# Important note

Although revA and revB may be tempting to build yourself because these revisions do not use BGA ICs, **do not do so unless you have a COMPLETE understanding of the pitfalls of the level shifter used in revA/B**. Thank you for understanding.

# 3D rendering note

To render the Glasgow boards:

* Use the 3D renderer in KiCad
* Enable raytracing
* Change the soldermask color to "Saturated Green" which is rgb(13, 104, 11)
* Export the resulting view to a .png file
* Do not use symlinks as they are not supported by GitHub pages.
